# DeliveryNest
We occasionally need to send something 
to someone who is at another location.
We have to physically travel there 
ourselves and deliver the package
in order to complete this task.
If we are unable to find someone
else to complete this duty for us, 
this becomes an inevitable issue.
Similar to this, finding a suitable
mode of transportation that can 
accommodate all the items we possess 
at once becomes challenging when 
we need to move our home or office
to a new area. In order to address
this issue, we are creating this
application (DeliveryNest) that allows
users to make reservations for a variety of 
services that will deliver their
goods in the quickest manner possible.
